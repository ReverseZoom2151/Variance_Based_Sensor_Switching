# Investigating Line-Following Robot Navigation through Variance-Based Sensor Switching: A Hybrid Approach to Optimizing Sensor Performance

## Description
The project is an Arduino-based initiative focused on developing and implementing various robotic algorithms and simulations. It explores a novel, cost-effective switching mechanism that dynamically selects between analog and digital sensor arrays based on real-time variance assessments, optimizing sensor performance without additional hardware. The project serves as an educational tool for those interested in robotics, offering practical examples and interactive experimentation.

## Features
### Variance-Based Sensor Switching üåü
This project introduces an innovative variance-based sensor switching mechanism that dynamically selects between analog and digital sensor arrays. This approach leverages the high-resolution data from analog sensors for precise control and the straightforward binary outputs from digital sensors for reliable navigation, enhancing sensor reading accuracy and adaptability to varying track conditions.
### Motor Control üèéÔ∏è
The motor control system is managed by the motors.h file, allowing for precise control of the robot's movements, including:
- Motor Initialization: Setting up motor pins and configurations.
- Speed Control: Functions to set the speed of both motors independently.
- Stopping Motors: A function to stop the motors, ensuring controlled halts.
